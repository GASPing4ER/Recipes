    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Are you a pizza person? (Is there a person who is not a pizza person?)</p>
    <p>We do pizza every Friday at our house! We usually make it right here at home. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups warm water (600 mL)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>7 cups all-purpose flour (875 g), plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup semolina flour (30 g)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. </li>
        <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. </li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. </li>
        <li>Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
